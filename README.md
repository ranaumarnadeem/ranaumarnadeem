I’m an Electrical Engineering student with a deep enthusiasm for embedded systems and hardware design. My focus areas include RTL design, IC testability, and FPGA development. Currently, I’m honing my skills as a research assistant at the System on Chip Lab, where I work on advancing IC testability.

I’m passionate about solving complex engineering problems and am always excited to dive into new projects and collaborate with others. From crafting Verilog code to exploring the latest in FPGA technology, I love pushing the boundaries of digital design.

In addition to my technical work, I share detailed articles on digital design topics on Medium and Substack(links given below).

Feel free to connect with me if you’re interested in discussing hardware design, HDL coding, or just want to share ideas about the future of technology!
