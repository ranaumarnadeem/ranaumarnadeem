I'm an enthusiastic digital hardware designer specializing in embedded systems and digital logic. Currently, I work as a **Research Assistant** at the **System on Chip Lab**, where I contribute to projects advancing **Design for testability and post-silicon validation**.

My core interests lie in:
-  RTL Design and HDL Coding (Verilog/SystemVerilog)
-  Design Verification (System Verilog, UVM ,RISCV-DV)
-  Design-for-Testability (DFT), ATPG, and Scan Architectures
-  FPGA Prototyping and SoC Design

I love diving deep into complex design problems—from writing synthesizable RTL to building Testability metric analyzers and testbench generators. Outside of the lab, I share my learnings through high-quality, beginner-friendly technical articles.
